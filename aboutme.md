My background is in Operations Research and Applied Mathematics. I am completing my Ph.D. in Operations research where my research focuses on optimal decision making via stochastic modeling and machine learning with applications to sequential decision problem. I am advised by <a href="http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/people.html">Prof. Han Liu</a> and <a href="https://wmassey.princeton.edu/">Prof. William Massey</a>. Before this, I earned a masters and a bachelors degree in Mathematics.

Strong experience in building data products and solving business problems using machine learning, statistics, and optimization. These practical skills were obtained through internships and rigorous projects.

In sum, I am excited about opportunities in the data science space, where I can leverage my strong data analytics background to help build better products and empower optimal business decision making.
