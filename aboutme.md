My academic background is in Operations Research (also known as Management Science) and Applied Mathematics. I am completing my Ph.D. in Operations research where my research focuses on optimal decision making via stochastic modeling and machine learning with applications to sequential decision problems. I am advised by <a href="http://magics.cs.northwestern.edu/people.html" target="_blank">Prof. Han Liu</a> and <a href="https://wmassey.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Prof. William Massey</a>. Before joining Princeton, I earned a masters and a bachelors degree in Mathematics from the City University of New York.

Strong experience in building data products and solving business problems using machine learning, statistics, and optimization. These practical skills were obtained through internships and rigorous projects.

In sum, I am excited about opportunities in the data science space, where I can leverage my strong data analytics background to help build better products and empower optimal business decision making.
